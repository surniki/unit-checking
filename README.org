* Unit Checking using C++ Templates

Here is a dump of some work done in Spring 2019 for exploring how unit
checking in type systems could lead to less errors when implementing
physical simulations. It is fairly straightforward to implement a
naive solution to this problem using C++ templates and following the
lead of Walter Brown's /SIUNITS/ library and the relevant section in the
textbook /Scientific and Engineering C++/ by Barton and
Nackman. Some additional operations are introduced, such as a way of
constructing wrappers around previously written numeric functions such
that the types accepted and returned are quantities with physical
units.

There are also slides that were used in a presentation at the Spring
2019 Research Symposium at Illinois State University as well an a
report that was written in order to describe the implementation of
unit checking in the C++ type system and its usage in a simple
physical simulation.
